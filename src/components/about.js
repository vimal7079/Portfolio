        Front-End Developer with a proven
ability to collaborate effectively with
senior developers while spending
extra time to be mentored. Enjoy
working closely with team members
to ensure workloads are effectively
redirected to bottlenecks and
personally picking up the slack when
necessary. With a passion for both
personal growth and for software
development, I attended a 1000+ hour
coding bootcamp to learn new
languages while sharpening existing
skills. Ready to apply my passion for
coding to a talented engineering
team to develop quality solutions.
